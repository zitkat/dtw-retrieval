# Dynamic time warping for retrieval of variable length sequences

## Plan
1. DTW and adaptive pooling experiments:
   1. Image retrieval on IAM, features from:
   - our custom transformer
   - Seq2seq
   - ResNet
   2. Speech retrieval?
   3. NLP retrieval?
2. Metric learning dtw
3. Quantization for variable length sequences

# TODO:
- generate resnet50 activations
- parallelize dtwn
- use soft dtw
- analysis
